# Getting Started

0. `git clone` this repo (if acquiring from GitHub)
1. `npm install` from project root to install dependencies 
2. `gulp` to build project - this will also open a browser-synced window
3. `gulp rr-test` from project root:
    - starts two local servers at localhost:8000 and localhost:8001 serving index.html
3. Open localhost:8000 and localhost:8001 in browser (I recommend Chrome)
4. Enjoy! Try sending yourself a message!


A. Alternatively, you could open two terminal sessions and `gulp` in the root folder in each session.
This will automatically open two browser tabs serving the app on different servers.

B. Or you could `gulp` in the root project folder and open two browser windows at address
`localhost:3000`. I've found this to be a risky/unreliable way of testing multiple React sessions locally. I've just run into weird problems.

C. Or vist the app live @ `jfejtek.com/rr-challenge`.
